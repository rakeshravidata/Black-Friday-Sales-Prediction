# King County Sales Prediction
## Abstract
The team built a model based on a housing dataset consisting of over 21,000 house
sales from September 2014 to January 2015 in order to predict housing prices. After
some data cleaning and transformation, we fit a linear model using ordinary least
squares estimation. The features most indicative of price variability were the year built
and lot size, while house ID and living size were relatively insignicant. Ultimately, the
results from this project follow what we would have expected, given previous research
in the housing domain.
